**Information.**

 Inside of this repository are three scripts, two shell scripts, and a python one.
 Their purpose? Automatically create a fully functional archlinux installation.

 If you are not me, you should use "autoarch_public.py" because, as the name sugests,
 it is made for public use as it asks the user to input **THEIR** own information, disk
 selection, etc...

 The other two scripts, the shell ones labeled "live" and "final" are for my personal
 use only, they are hard coded with my computer hardware and needs in mind, and will be
 updated acordingly, if I get a new gpu, for example.

**Why does this exist?**

 To put it simply, I have a crippling disease called "distro hopping", but I always end
 up coming back to archlinux, so to make my hands and brain happy, I decided to create a
 repository containing scripts that would automatically install my desired OS without much
 effort.

**If you made this for personal use only, why does the python version exist?**

 I was bored.
